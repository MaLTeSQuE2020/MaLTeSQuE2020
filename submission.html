                    <!--<p><b>The assessment of software quality </b> is one of the most multifaceted (e.g., structural quality, product quality, process quality, etc.) and subjective aspects of software engineering (since in many cases it is substantially based on expert judgement). Such assessments can be performed at almost all phases of software development (from project inception to maintenance) and at different levels of granularity (from source code to architecture). However, human judgement is: (a) inherently biased by implicit, subjective criteria applied in the evaluation process, and (b) its economical effectiveness is limited compared to automated or semi-automated approaches. To this end, researchers are still looking for new, more effective methods of assessing various qualitative characteristics of software systems and the related processes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
					<b>In recent years we have been observing a rising interest in adopting various approaches to exploit machine learning (ML) </b>and automated decision-making processes in several areas of software engineering. These models and algorithms help to alleviate human subjectivity in order to make informed decisions based on available data and evaluated with objective criteria. Thus, the adoption of ML techniques is a promising way to improve software quality evaluation. Conversely, learning capabilities are increasingly embedded within software, including in critical domains such as automotive and health. This calls for the application of quality assurance techniques to ensure the reliable engineering of ML-based software systems. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>The aim of the workshop</b> is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss new ideas, trends and results concerning the application of ML methods to software quality evaluation and the application of software engineering techniques to self-learning systems. We expect that the workshop will help in (1) the validation of existing ML methods for software quality evaluation as well as their application to novel contexts, (2) the effectiveness evaluation of ML methods, both compared to other automated approaches and the human judgement, (3) the adaptation of ML approaches already used in other areas of science in the context of software quality, (4) the design of new techniques to validate ML-based software, inspired by traditional software engineering techniques. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br>
- Application of machine-learning in software quality evaluation, <br>
- Analysis of multi-source data, <br>
- Knowledge acquisition from software repositories, 
- Adoption and validation of machine learning models and algorithms in software quality, <br>
- Decision support and analysis in software  quality, <br>
- Prediction models to support software quality evaluation, <br>
- Validation and verification of learning systems, <br>
- Automated machine learning, <br>
- Design of safety-critical learning software,<br>
- Integration of learning systems in software ecosystems. </p>-->

<h3>Evaluation Criteria and Submission</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">TBD</p>

<!--<p>We expect papers up to 6 pages (including references) in the ESEC/FSE conference format (ACM, double-column). Each paper will be reviewed by three PC members.  Accepted papers will be part of ESEC/FSE proceedings. All papers should be submitted in PDF format through
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=maltesque2019" target="blank"><span class="label">EasyChair</span></a></p>-->

<h3>Special Issue</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">TBD</p>

<!--<p>Authors of selected papers accepted at MaLTeSQuE 2019 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue of the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software" target="blank"><span class="label">Journal of Software and Systems (JSS)</span></a>, edited by Elsevier.</p>-->

<!-- <p style="color: black">We are looking for original research (even at early stages of evaluation) on how machine learning techniques can be applied into software quality evaluation problems. The maximum length of workshop papers is 6 pages (including references), and they will be part of the SANER 2018 proceedings and available by participants in advance through a workshop webpage. All papers should be submitted in PDF format (conforming to the IEEE conferences template) through 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=maltesque2018" target="blank"><span class="label">EasyChair</span></a>
<br>
<br>
<b style="color: black">Important note: the process for paper submission and evaluation will be similar to SANER. Therefore, all submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer review process, with emphasis on their originality, quality, soundness and relevance. Like SANER, the workshop will follow a double-blind review process, where three PC members will review the submitted papers. </b>
<br>
<br>
The workshop will follow a one-day format, consisting of 3 to 4 sessions. The workshop is intended to be highly interactive: for this reason, each accepted paper will have a maximum of 15/20 minutes for presentation, followed by 10/15 minutes for questions and discussion. We hope that the workshop will foster and promote collaboration, and there will be time set aside to support this. We also plan to support a wide dissemination of the accepted contributions as well as the participants discussion through Facebook and Twitter.
